ABOUT

Spacex is an app that visualizes the predicted path of Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX. 

It requires you to enter the latitude, longitude, altitude, and the radius to search for the satellites that match the requirements. Then you can decide for how long you want to track these satellites and select the satellites to show on the map.

The map will show the predicted path for a satellite (one second in real life is one minute for the satellite).
